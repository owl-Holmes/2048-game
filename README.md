## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `main.java.Main`: main launcher and UI
- `main.java.game2048.board.GameBoard`: game logic
- `resources/`: styles, images, best score file registration

---

## ❌ What is missing

- The UI is not 100% corresponding to the official 2048 game
- Any animation
- Separation of the JavaFX code in different files is not correctly done and everything is in the Main file
